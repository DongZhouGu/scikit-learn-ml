Subject: moon image in weather sat image



an image of the moon has been caught in a weather satellite images of the earth.
it appears in both the 0430-1500UT ir and visual images of the earth.
the GIF images can be down loaded from vmd.cso.uiuc.edu and are named
CI043015.GIF and CV043015.GIF for the IR and visual images respectively.

pretty cool pictures;  in the ir it's saturated but in the visual image
details on the moon are viewable.

the moon is not in the 1400UT images.
