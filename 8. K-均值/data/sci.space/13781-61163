Subject: Space Design Movies?

Is there a few Grasp pictures of space related items, namely Space Station
Designs, so you can see the "finished" revolt around..

If you don't know what a grasp prograsm is.. Check out some adult entertainment
files and see what I mean.. Or maybe geta few GIF files and create a "slide
shows" (I think Cshow can do this).. 

I liek to be able to see a space shuttle design in a AutoCAD program or to see
it revolt around and look at it.
