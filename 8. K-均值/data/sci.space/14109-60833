Subject: Quotation? Lowest bidder...
From: bioccnt@otago.ac.nz


Can someone please remind me who said a well known quotation? 

He was sitting atop a rocket awaiting liftoff and afterwards, in answer to
the question what he had been thinking about, said (approximately) "half a
million components, each has to work perfectly, each supplied by the lowest
bidder....." 

Attribution and correction of the quote would be much appreciated.
