Subject: The Area Rule

I read it refered to as the "parabolic cross-section" rule;
the idea was that if you plot the area of the fuselage cross-
section as a function of the point fore-and-aft along the 
fuselage, a plot that is a **paraboloid** minimizes somethin' 
or 'nother (to be technical about it).
