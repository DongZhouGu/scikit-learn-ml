Subject: DOS 6.0 compression API: partial answer

For those of you looking for information on MS-DOS 6.0's
file system compression API:

Today I called Microsoft's DOS 6.0 hotline at (800)228-7007.
They told me that the DOS 6.0 Resource Kit had the specifications
for the compression interface.  The Resource Kit costs $19.95,
plus tax and $5 shipping.

I ordered a copy and will post further when I get it and know more
about it.  I am posting now because the order turnaround is 15 
working days.  

If anyone knows for sure where's there's a good
source of info on this API, please speak up.  I am 
slightly skeptical about the Resource Kit's likelihood
of having detailed programming info.

(posted also to sci.crypt, since the API could presumably also
be used for file system encryption.)
