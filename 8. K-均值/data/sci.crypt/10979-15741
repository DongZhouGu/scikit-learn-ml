	In what way David?  Our government is totally out of control,
	whether you realize it or not.  I know you find it painful to
	think of your old buddy Uncle Sam as evil but it's true.  Other
	democracies have fallen before.  Ours is on its way and knee-jerk
	sheep that instinctively trust government are helping it slide.
	Power corrupts David, why is that so hard to understand?
