Subject: Brain Tumor Treatment (thanks)

There were a few people who responded to my request for info on
treatment for astrocytomas through email, whom I couldn't thank
directly because of mail-bouncing probs (Sean, Debra, and Sharon).  So
I thought I'd publicly thank everyone.

Thanks! 

(I'm sure glad I accidentally hit "rn" instead of "rm" when I was
trying to delete a file last September. "Hmmm... 'News?' What's
this?"....)
