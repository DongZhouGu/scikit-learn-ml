Subject: CS "gas" and allergic response- Ques.

This question derives from the Waco incident:
	Could CS ("gas") particles create an allergic response which would 
result in laryngospasm and asphyxiation?- especially in children.

	DNC in Ok.
	OSU-COM will disavow my opinion, and my existence, if necessary.
