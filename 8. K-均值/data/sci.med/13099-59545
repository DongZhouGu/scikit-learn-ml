Subject: Investigating Phenylanine?

Resinfo (research and information) is currently seeking contact

Resinfo is not a regular subscriber to sci.med due to the 
excessive load of data and regrettably, our limited ability
to monitor. It would therefore be appreciated if replies
could be sent direct to;
