Subject: Chelation therapy

Does anyone here know anything about chelation therapy using EDTA?  My
uncle has emphesema, and a doctor wants to try it on him.  We are
wondering if:

1.  Is there any evidence EDTA chelation therapy is beneficial for his
condition, or any condition?

2.  What possible side effects are there.  How can they be mimimized?

Please respond via e-mail to    rme1@cornell.edu

Thanks,
Renee
