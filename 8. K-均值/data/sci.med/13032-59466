Subject: Chromium as dietary suppliment for weight loss


My wife has requested that I poll the Sages of Usenet to see what is
known about the use of chromium in weight-control diet suppliments.
She has seen multiple products advertising it and would like any kind
real information.

My first impulse was "Yuck! a metal!" but I have zero data on it.

What do you know?
