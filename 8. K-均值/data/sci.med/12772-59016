Subject: Re: Lasers for dermatologists

It is not true that dermatologists gave not reached the laser age, in
fact, lasers in dermatological surgery is a very new and exciting field.

It probably won't be effective in tinea pedis because the laser is
usually a superficial burn (to avoid any deeper damage). Limited tinea
pedis can be cured albeit sometimes slowly by topical antifungals as
well as systemic medication i.e. tablets. Finally, a self-diagnosis is
not always reliable, lichen simplex chronicus can look like a fungal
infection and requires very different treatment.
