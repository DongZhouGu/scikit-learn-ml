Subject: ringing ears



A friend of mine has a trouble with her ears ringing.  The ringing is so loud
that she has great difficulty sleeping at night.  She says that she hasn't 
had a normal night's sleep in about 6 months (she looks like it too :-().
This is making her depressed so her doctor has put her on anti-depressants.

The ringing started rather suddenly about 6 months ago.  She is quickly losing
sleep, social life and sanity over this.

Does anyone know of any treatments for this?  Any experience?  Coping
mechanisms?  Any opinions on the anti-depressant drugs?
