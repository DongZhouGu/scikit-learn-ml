Subject: Speaker design software?

Hi.  I'm looking for software to aid a friend of mine with designing speakers.
Does this type of software exist?  If anyone can point me toward a shareware or
freeware product with this description, that would be ideal.

...Steve van der Burg (using a friend's account)

(p.s. Excuse the terseness of the message;  I'm having difficulty stringing
readable sentences together today, for some reason.)
