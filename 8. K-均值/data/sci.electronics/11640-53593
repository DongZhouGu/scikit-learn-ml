Subject: Electrical Properties of ELASTOMERS


Hello,

I am looking for carbon-doped rubber.    Or an highly elastic material that changes its resistivity, or some
other electrical property when streched.

If you could email me any info you may have on material names or companies that make the stuff
it would be highly appreaciated.

Thanx
