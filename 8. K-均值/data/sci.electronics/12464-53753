Does anyone know what frequencies the wireless transmitter/receiver
microphone systems that Radio Shack sells operate at?  I've tried
everything short of opening one up (not actually owning one makes
this difficult...) and just looking..  Any help would be greatly
appreciated..  These systems are designed for wireless PA systems, etc..
 
 
					Thanks,
