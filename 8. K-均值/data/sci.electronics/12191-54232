Subject: Caltech PUFF PD ftp? RF Tools?

Hi there,

Does anyone know whether the PUFF RF design package is available
via ftp from any site? As I understand it, it is in the public
domain - please correct me if I'm wrong on this one.

Any other PD RF design tools out there that can be recommended?
Especially microstrip filter tools...
