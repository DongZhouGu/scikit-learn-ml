Subject: Need Hydrophone Info.


I don't know much about Hydrophones, so I'm looking for any information
that will help avoid problems I haven't thought of! I would like an 
inexpensive hydrophone and amplifier with tape (line level) outputs...
something like Edmund sells for $250. They also sell just the microphone
(hydrophone) head for $24, but how does one construct the enclosure?
Any information would be greatly appreciated, Thanks!
