Subject: NeXT cube board monitor cable ?

Hi all!
	Quick question.  Could someone please send me a pinout of
the cable that goes between a NeXT cube and the monitor?  Also,
I am interested in the video signal (sync type, horz/vert rate)
so any information on that would be greatly appreciated also.

Thanks!
