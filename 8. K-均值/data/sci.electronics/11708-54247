Subject: Re: How universal are phones these days?

I don't know much about phones in Germany, but this is what I know: I bought
a phone in the U.S. for my mother who lives in Bratislava, Slovakia and it
works just fine. The problem is they don't have wall jacks like we do here.
There is a wire without any jack at the end sticking out of the wall. So you
need to connect the wires (I'm not sure if they have wall jacks in Western
Europe - they may). Hope this helps. Dagmar kniha@carson.u.washington.edu
