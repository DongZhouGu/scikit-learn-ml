You might want to get a disposible flash camera, shoot the roll of film,
then take it apart (they're snapped together). We used a bunch of them
at my wedding, but instead of sending the whole camera in, I just took
the film out (it's a standard 35mm canister), and kept the batteries
(they use one AA battery). Sorry, I didn't keep any of the flash electronics.
