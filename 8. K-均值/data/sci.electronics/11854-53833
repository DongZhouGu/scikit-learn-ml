Subject: Long distance IR detection


--

I would like to be able to detect the angular position (low accuracy) of an
IR emitting source at a distance of about 100 meters (more is better) in
daylight.  The IR source could be emitting a signature; I'm leaning toward
30 KHz square wave with 50% duty cycle.

I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc. to give
information to a pan/tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the
angles.  For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LED(s),
possibly an Optek OP290 or Motorola MLED81.  Wazing would mean at least 1 Amp
current pulses.  At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to 10% and I
would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the 50% required.

Has anyone done something like this?
