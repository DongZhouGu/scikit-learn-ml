Subject: decoupling caps - onboard

(posted for a friend)
hello there,
        I would like to know if any one had any experience with having
on-board decoupling capacitors (inside a cmos chip) for the power
lines. Say I have a lot of space left im my pad limited design.
any data on the effect of oxide breakdown? any info or pointers
are appreciated.
